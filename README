NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromPrev - Bump your version internally for
    use at release time

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin was written because the author didn't like the time-based
    version RJBS likes to use as implemented in
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AutoVersion. Instead this plugin supports the
    classic CPAN version schema where you start at 0.01 and move towards
    0.99, then increment to 1.00 and keep going from there.

    This is how you use the plugin:

        [VersionFromPrev]

    or more verbosely:

        [VersionFromPrev]
        version_style = Classic
        version_finder = Git::LastVersion

    For this to work you have to save your version somewhere persistently
    like in Git using Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Tag. What'll then happen is
    that:

    *   When Dist::Zilla starts up we'll find the existing version using
        *::Git::LastVersion.

    *   We'll bump the version internally using e.g. *::Classic.

    *   You have to use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Tag so or manually set a
        new Git tag on release so that *::Git::LastVersion can find in the
        next time you run "dzil release".

    If you don't like the defaults then you can write your own version
    provider plugin and make it use that by supplying another
    "version_style" and "version_finder" in the
    "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromPrev::Style" and
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromPrev::Finder namespaces.

ATTRIBUTES
  version_style
    The short name of the version style plugin you want to use. "Classic" by
    default.

  version_provider
    The short name of the version provider plugin you want to use.
    "Git::LastVersion". by default.

Environment
    This module understands the following environmental variables:

    *   "DONT_BUMP_VERSION"

        If set the version won't be bumped at all. Useful for producing a
        tarball for your last release.

    *   "BUMP_VERSION_TO"

        Bump the version to a given version, e.g. "DONT_BUMP_VERSION=1.00".
        Useful if you want to skip a version or go from e.g. 0.10 to 1.00.

BUGS
    Yes, and probably some that I don't know about. It works for me, if it
    doesn't for you fork it on GitHub & patch it & release it.
